He's just started at Furin High School, a school of degenerates known only for their brawling strength—strength they use to protect their town from anyone who wishes it ill. But Haruka's not interested in being a hero or being part of any sort of team—he just wants to fight his way to the top!",

At the same time, the orphaned Hina Amano also strives to find work to sustain herself and her younger brother.",

At the same time, Taki Tachibana, a high school student, lives in Tokyo and has a great interest in architecture, aiming to become an urban planner in the near future.",
    "Stubborn, spoiled, and naïve, 10-year-old Chihiro Ogino is less than pleased when she and her parents discover an abandoned amusement park on the way to their new house. Cautiously venturing inside, she realizes that there is more to this place than meets the eye, as strange things begin to happen once dusk falls.",
    "Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by monstrous humanoid creatures called Titans, forcing humans to hide in fear behind enormous concentric walls. What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure.",
    "As the seasons pass by, the end of Mochizou Ooji's third and final school year quickly approaches. He aims to study at a university in Tokyo, but at the cost of leaving behind his loved ones—including his beloved childhood crush, Tamako Kitashirakawa. Having no such plans for the future, Tamako will merely remain in town to work at her family's humble mochi shop.",
